Phase 1: 🔍 Project Definition
Goals:

    Assess demand for aquariums/aquaria products in Morocco.

    Identify profitable regions, segments (B2C, B2B, luxury, entry-level).

    Quantify startup and operational costs.

    Simulate ROI scenarios.

    Understand logistical, legal, and environmental constraints.

Deliverables:

    Strategic report (PDF)

    Financial modeling workbook

    Interactive dashboard (optional)

    Slide presentation

Phase 2: 🌍 Data Collection
Key Data Areas:
🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Demographics & Economy

    HCP, World Bank, IMF

    Urban/rural split, regional income levels

    Internet & mobile penetration

🐠 Pet & Aquaria Market

    Ownership trends (TGM, GlobalPETS)

    Pet types and aquaria preference

    Estimated spend per household

🛍️ Competition & Distribution

    Online stores (Ubuy, Jumia, PetWorld)

    Local shops (Aquarium Maroc, AquaFishop)

    Public aquariums (e.g., Morocco Mall)

💰 Cost & Regulation

    Tariffs (HS codes: 70200019, 842121, etc.)

    Import rules (ATLAS, ONSSA)

    Urban planning (PLU), water/electricity access

    Species restrictions (CITES, invasive plants)

💡 Tools: Manual research, web scraping, FOI requests, local surveys.
Phase 3: 🧼 Data Cleaning
Steps:

    Handle missing and duplicate values

    Convert all monetary values to MAD (historical exchange rates)

    Normalize column names, date formats, categories

    Create derived metrics:

        CAGR of pet ownership

        Cost per unit (import CIF + taxes)

        Revenue per customer

Output Files:

    cleaned_demographics.csv

    cleaned_pet_market.csv

    cleaned_import_data.csv

    cleaned_cost_structure.csv

Phase 4: 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visual Analyses:

    Growth in pet ownership by region

    Import trends (volume/value by country)

    Revenue vs income levels

    E-commerce vs. retail share

    Competitor mapping

Tools:

import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import plotly.express as px

Optional: Use geopandas or folium for regional insights.
Phase 5: 📈 Financial Modeling
Components:
CAPEX:

    Store setup / site construction

    Equipment stock

    Licensing & IT systems

OPEX:

    Salaries

    Utilities (filtration, heating, water)

    Recurrent stock imports

    Marketing

Revenue Streams:

    Product sales (hardware, fish, plants)

    Services (maintenance, consulting, custom builds)

Modeling Scenarios:

    Conservative: Low adoption, high OPEX

    Moderate: Balanced operations

    Ambitious: Scalable e-commerce success

Tools:

    Python (numpy, pandas)

    Excel (dashboards, breakeven charts)

📁 Deliverable: financial_model.py or financial_model.xlsx
Phase 6: ⚖️ Regulatory & Feasibility Assessment
Topics to Address:

    PLU zoning maps for retail sites

    ONSSA import certifications

    Environmental assessments (for marine fauna)

    Utility availability and cost

    Logistic chain (air/sea, live animal handling)

📁 Deliverable: regulatory_summary.md
Phase 7: 🤖 Machine Learning (Optional but Valuable)
Use Cases:

    Time-series forecasting of demand

        Tools: fbprophet, ARIMA

    Customer segmentation

        Tools: KMeans, PCA

    Sentiment analysis of online reviews

        Tools: nltk, textblob, transformers

📁 Models saved in: /models/
